# Hi I am Braulee
<br>
<p><em>Currently studying at <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/">Portland State University </a></em></p>

I enjoy learning and breaking things constantly. My preferred language of choice is C++ as I 
enjoy working in low level technologies but I have experience in many languages and 
framework. I'm big on open source and freely avaible software as well as privacy.

Some of the projects I'm most proud of include:

[Spotify Record Player](https://github.com/Braulee7/Spotify-RFID-Record-Player):
  - One of the first projects I created when starting to learn code.
    I designed, 3D printed, and programmed a lamp for my partner that is capable
    of playing spotify albums and playlist at the touch of an RFID card
    
[Procdedural Generation](https://github.com/Braulee7/Procedural-Generation-OpenGL):
  - I created a procedurally generated terrain using perlin noise and rendered it
    with the Vulkan framework
    
[HevEngine] Private:
  - I'm currently working on a game engine to learn more about it with hands on
    experience and push my fundamentals on low level programming and optimizations
    
```c++
class Braulee : public PSUCSGrad {
public:
  Braulee()
    : exp('SDE Intern @ Amazon',
          'SWE Intern @ Amazon'),
      intrst('Computer Graphics',
             'Optimizations and Algorithms',
             'Networking')
{}

~Braulee() = default;

Date GradDate() const override { return '06/13/2025';}
private:
  Experience exp;
  Interests intrst;
};
```
